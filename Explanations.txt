1. No .env key ==> cp .env.example .env; php artisan key:generate

2. AddNewColumnsUsersTable ==> you are better off storing dates as string in laravel. I also made alll fields nullable

3. I changed db to sqlite in .env ==> touch database/database.sqlite

4. I created the user using a model.. it gives a lot of ways for setting am=nd accessing attributes.
