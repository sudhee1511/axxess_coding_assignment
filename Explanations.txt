1. AddNewColumnsUsersTable ==> stored all dates as string in the db. (made the fields nullable)
2. I changed db to sqlite in .env ==> touch database/database.sqlite
3. I created the user using a model.
4. Added the start date as a input field on the sign up page.
5. After signup up, adding the visit date on the add visit page leads to url what I specified in the code. I can change it to whatever but was not sure. I added the comments too there in the code.
6. Ran the local db server on sqlite and was able to succesfully add user, add a visit to patient, process missed vists and return api.
